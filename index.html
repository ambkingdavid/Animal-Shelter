                  to
                  maintaining a proper health and condition. And feeding is one of the most important aspects that

                  savior of that soul and you are responsible for his life from that point forward. The post-adoption
                  time
                  is a real treat for anyone that is looking for a furry companion. However, the pre-adoption process
                  can
                  be a real nightmare for those that do not know much about adoptions. For more information please visit

                  days, with clear cutting trees for new housing development that is going on. Some species are slowly
                  becoming extinct. That means that our rapid growth might cause the complete disappearance of certain
                  types of animals. Surely we, as responsible individuals, can do something about this. But what is

        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3"> Animal Shelter</h2>
        <h5 class="mb-4"> Adopt a dog or a cat today</h5>
        <article class="mb-5">
          <img class="img-fluid float-start" src="	https://animalshelter.org/images/boy_with_dog.jpg	" alt="">
          <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-1 ">Every year thousands of animals are dropped off at the side of the road
            because owners didn?t properly spay
            or neuter their pets, resulting in unwanted puppies and kittens. Other times, pet owners simply cannot
            afford to take care of an animal anymore or they are moving to a home that won?t allow them to bring their
            beloved pet with them. No matter what the reason, there are thousands of homeless pets on the streets of
            cities and communities all over the country. But, there don?t have to be. An additional 6 to 8 million
            animals are already finding homes in shelters all across the country.</p>

          <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-1 ">With the help of animal shelters, these animals can find homes. If you are in
            the market for a new pet or
            you find yourself in a situation where you are unable to keep your pet anymore, here are a few reasons you
            should choose an animal shelter:</p>

          <img class="img-fluid float-start" src="	https://animalshelter.org/images/adopt-a-cat.jpg	" alt="">

          <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-1 ">
            If you are in search of a family-friendly pet, check your shelter first. Many shelters have puppies and
            kittens but you may find that your heart opens up to an older animal. When you choose to adopt an animal for
            a local shelter, you can be guaranteed that your animal has been monitored and checked out by a veterinarian
            before you take them home. Animal shelters try to ensure that pets have received their shots and many dogs
            and cats will have already been spayed and neutered. Additionally, pets who have been given to the animal
            shelter from previous homes are more likely to have been exposed to children.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-1 ">
            Adopting adult animals allows you to really see the personality of the dog, you may not even have to
            bathroom train an adult dog or cat. When you go to a shelter to choose your pet you can observe your future
            family member?s behavior closely. Additionally shelter volunteers can provide more information about their
            medical background, personality and the circumstances that caused their arrival at the shelter.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-1">
            Before you take your pet home many shelters offer the option of tagging your pet, which includes the
            implantation of a GPS device so your new family member can be located quickly if they become lost.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-1">
            When your adopt a pet from a shelter you are not supporting puppy and kitten mills. Puppy and kitten mills
            are essentially breeding facilities for dogs and cats. Many times the animals are not well-taken care of.
            Many, but not all, stores receive animals from puppy mills or kennels. Animal mills create over-population
            of cats and dogs and often result in genetic problems that could lead to illness and death for the animals.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-1">
            Animal mills (usually puppy mills) provide little care and human interaction with the dogs. These facilities
            promote irresponsible breeding practices and focus more on their bottom line than the welfare of the animals
            they shelter. Supporting stores and organizations that purchase animals from these facilities funds their
            behavior. When you adopt a pet from a shelter your funds are used to help more animals who have been
            discarded, lost or left behind.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-1">
            Animal adoption is much more affordable than purchasing an animal from a pet store. The low adoption rates
            are great for families who cannot afford to purchase an animal from a private owner or other pet-friendly
            shop.
          </p>

          <img src="https://animalshelter.org/images/adopt-a-pet.jpg" class="float-start" alt="adopt a dog">

          <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-1">
            Fortunately, and perhaps a little unfortunately, animal shelters receive new dogs and cats regularly. This
            means that you can go to a shelter and not find a pet you really meld with. If this happens, the shelter
            volunteers will be more than happy to help you when you come back again.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-1">
            Most animals dwelling in animal shelters have either been abandoned or become lost without anyway to
            identify their owner. Animal shelters provide a warm, safe place for animals to stay until their owner, or
            new family comes to take them home. Animals wandering the street are much more likely to become ill, injured
            or killed.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-1">
            Not only do animal shelters benefit the community by taking stray dogs and cats from the streets, they
            provide an invaluable service to helpless animals.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-1">
            Animal shelters provide cats and dogs with a warm place to sleep, play and eat. Veterinarians check each
            animal to make sure they have received all of their vaccinations and are properly taken care of. Volunteers
            play a big role in ensuring the animals receive the right amount of exercise and attention.

            In addition to providing medical and playful attention, animals here are safe from cars and other hazards
            they could fall prey to if left to their own devices.

            Many shelters provide behavioral training and/or observation of the cats and dogs living in the shelter.
            This allows the shelter to inform potential families how a certain pet may react in their home. Nervous or
            skittish pets are given time to acclimate and warm up to humans before they are adopted out.
